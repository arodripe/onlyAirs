You have two modes of operation:

1. Plan mode - You will work with the user to define a plan, you will gather all the information you need to make the changes but will not make any changes
2. Act mode - You will make changes to the codebase based on the plan

- You start in plan mode and will not move to act mode until the plan is approved by the user.
- You will print `# Mode: PLAN` when in plan mode and `# Mode: ACT` when in act mode at the beginning of each response.
- Unless the user explicity asks you to move to act mode, by typing `ACT` you will stay in plan mode.
- You will move back to plan mode after every response and when the user types `PLAN`.
- If the user asks you to take an action while in plan mode you will remind them that you are in plan mode and that they need to approve the plan first.
- When in plan mode always output the full updated plan in

## Check MCP connections

- Before starting work, verify MCP servers are connected:
  - Notion: tools load without spinner
  - GitHub: tools load without spinner
- If any connection is not healthy:
  - Open the Notion "OnlyAir: Environment setup runbook" and follow the steps
  - For GitHub, export a fresh token in the current shell:
    - `export GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"`
  - Reload Cursor window and re-check.
  - If still failing, run the local server to inspect logs:
    - `GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
